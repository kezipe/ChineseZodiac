 ChineseZodiac

ChineseZodiac is an iOS app created that allows users to input a birthday and find out which Chinese Zodiac is associated with people born on that day. Users can save several entries to keep them in a list, and the app can match them up based on romantic or friendship compatibility.

## Installation

To run the ChineseZodiac app, you will need to have Xcode 12 or later installed on your Mac. Once you have Xcode installed, you can clone the repository to your local machine using the following command:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/trufflethumb/ChineseZodiac.git
```

Then, open the `ChineseZodiac.xcodeproj` file in Xcode and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.

## Usage

When you open the ChineseZodiac app, you will be taken to the home screen with some sample entries. Tap on the "Plus" button will take you to a screen where you can input a birthday using the date picker. Once you have selected a birthday, tap the "Save" button to save the entry to your list.

You can view your list of saved entries by tapping the "List" button on the home screen. On the list screen, you can see all of your saved entries and their associated Chinese Zodiac sign.

If you have more than one entry in your list, you can tap the "Match" button on the home screen to see romantic or friendship compatibility between your entries. The app will use the Chinese Zodiac signs associated with each entry to determine compatibility.

## Privacy

ChineseZodiac uses Core Data to save all data entered by the user and does not track the user in any way. The app does not need the Internet and will not connect to the Internet in any way.
